## Introduction


### What is this exercise about?
This is an exercise focused on coping with a situation resulting from a researcher discovering some very emotionally disturbing personal materials in archives and having to communicate them to a Holocaust survivor.  

### What's expected of you?
+ Read the story of Nemka.
+ Find more information about her family in digital archives and see the structure of the database.
+ Watch the documentary film "Forgotten Transport to Estonia" and write an essay about this transport.
+ Think about and discuss the ethical dilemma of the researcher.


## Her story
Anne Marie Steiner was born in 1924 to a wealthy Jewish family in the center of Prague, Czechoslovakia. She was a very athletic girl, but she also loved literature and cinema. Her nickname amongst her friends in the Zionist Youth Club was Nemka. In the club, they often discussed their collective future - they wanted to live in a kibbutz and enjoy community life. They all attended Zionist preparatory school in Prague and in the spring of 1939, they expected to go to Palestine on a trip organized by the youth club.   

In the summer of 1939, the organizers of the Zionist Youth Clubs changed the plan and decided to send Nemka and the other teenagers to Denmark, where the local organization **Women´s League for Peace and Freedom** (Kvindernes Internationale Liga for Fred og Frihed), offered to help. The organization found Danish foster families for these Czech Jewish teenagers. After four years in Denmark, Nemka and her future husband (also Czech) Karel Steiner escaped to Sweden in 1943. When the war was over, they spent some time in Czechoslovakia and Israel before settling in Canada.  

In 2010, Czech researcher Judita Matyasova started research of this forgotten story of Czech Jewish teens. A few weeks after the death of Nemka´s husband in December 2011, Judita found a way to contact Nemka and called her for the first time. Nemka was very happy when she heard about Judita´s research, which would allow her to share her stories from pre-wartime and wartime. One day, Nemka made a request of Judita: “May I ask you for a favour? I never found out what happened to my mother. I only know she was in ghetto Theresienstadt and then she was killed somewhere in Estonia. I know you are a very good researcher, so maybe you can find out more details for me? Please tell me the truth about my mother!“  

Judita immediately knew where to search because she was familiar with the famous documentary film “Forgotten Transport to Estonia,” filmed by Czech historian, Lukas Pribyl. She rewatched the film and also read the book about this topic. Judita found out that Marianne (Nemka’s mother) was two months in ghetto Theresienstadt and then she was imprisoned and deported to Estonia with a group of 1.000 Jewish people. In the town of Raasiku, there was a selection. 100 young women were sent to a labour camp. All others, including Nemka´s mother, went by bus to the beach Kalevi Liiva. There, they were ordered to strip naked and dig their own graves. Then they were shot by Nazi guards.  

When Judita told Nemka about the film and the book, Nemka asked this: “So, what did you find out about my mother? Some photos? Or other details?”. In the book, Judita had found photos of a pile of corpses, and it could be possible that Nemka might recognize her mother within it.

## Digital archives and databases of names and fates of holocaust survivors
Every research project is like a big puzzle. You have to collect as many of those puzzle pieces as possible. There are main databases, which are essential for your start. Here you will find descriptions of digital archives and explanations of how to find a specific story and get more information.  

### Digital archive - USC Shoah Foundation
The [Visual History Archive](https://sfi.usc.edu/) of the [USC Shoah Foundation](https://vhaonline.usc.edu/login) allows users to search through and view more than 54,000 video testimonies of survivors and witnesses of genocide. Initially a repository of Holocaust testimony, the Visual History Archive has expanded to include testimonies from the Armenian Genocide that coincided with World War I, the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in China, the Cambodian Genocide of 1975-1979, the Guatemalan Genocide of 1978-1983, the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, the ongoing conflicts in the Central African Republic and South Sudan, and anti-Rohingya mass violence. It also includes testimonies about contemporary acts of violence against Jews.

### Digital archive – Holocaust.cz
This [database](https://www.holocaust.cz/en/database-of-victims/) contains the names and fates of about 80,000 people who have been deported from the territory of today’s Czech Republic and other European countries during WWII because the Nazis categorized them as Jews. Most of them were deported first to the ghetto Theresienstadt, and from there later on to the extermination camps. Exact addresses can be found for those living in Prague during the 1941 registration.

## Recording testimonies and ethical dilemmas
Researchers might face various ethical dilemmas during their work. Every case is specific, and it is impossible to give universal advice, but there are specific rules for oral history work recommended by the international organization the **Oral History Association**. Read more about the ethical rules of the Oral History Association [here](https://www.oralhistory.org/oha-statement-on-ethics/).  

A quote from Czech researcher Judita Matyasova:  
“I don’t think you can be prepared for such a difficult moments as it is described in this educational material, but it is up to every researcher, where he/she sees responsibility for the story and responsibility to the interviewee. It is not easy to decide what to do in this situation, but I truly believe we have talk about these ethical dilemmas and share our experience, as it is also part of our professional work.”

<font color="blue">
**Task No. 10**

Would you tell Nemka the whole truth?   
OR  
Tell Nemka something like a half-truth?  
OR  
Another option?
